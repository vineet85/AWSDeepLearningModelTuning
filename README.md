# Project Name - Hyperparameter Tuning
Understand hyperparameter tuning. Take a pretrained model with a standard dataset, and experiment with hyperparameters.

## Datasets
CIFAR-10.

## Modeling Strategy
Run multiple versions of the model with different hyperparamters.

## End Goal
Identify the optimal set of hyperparameters that produce the model that has the best accuracy
